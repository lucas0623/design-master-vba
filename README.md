## Introduction
For a long time, there has been a notable lack of reliable and systematic tools for design calculations using Excel spreadsheets. This gap often results in a prolonged design process and diminished design quality.

This excel add-in addressed the issue by streamlining the daily design process with calculation using user's excel spreadsheets. It offers tools to expedite data processing, transitioning seamlessly from structural analysis results to the preparation of design reports. ![Pasted image 20250102141621](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ab6d8ad-b2a4-4268-b27a-00681edfd46c)

Once the add-in is installed, a new ribbon titled 'Design Master' will appear in every Excel workbook you open. You can access all the add-in's features and functionalities through this ribbon.
